Story & Scenario Questions
1. B) Fictional but realistic composite inspired by real incidents. I like the idea of it involving an attack on logins as everyone is familiar with this. Credential stuffing, phishing attacks, perhaps even social engineering from a bad actor to trick staff into handing over MFA codes.
2. Keep the company profile but develop it further as you suggested.
3. Yes, an antagonist would be brilliant to help drive the storyline. Perhaps the antagonist is not revealed until the second session, once the team have investigated enough to uncover a 'calling card', or a new development occurs that involves direct communication from the bad actor.

Gameplay & Pacing Questions
4. Any and all. For timing based moments, students might simply have to set a timer to discuss and make a decision. Decision based would involve *some* storyline branching, but only to the extent that the decisions they make will dictate what information and what quality of information they end up with. For example, students might choose to investigate a service ticket in more detail, and the staff member reveals details that raise the stakes or point to a potential lead being a non-lead (e.g. staff member says "I haven't given my password to anyone. The IT guy who called me yesterday for the authorisation code even said that IT will never ask for my password" - revealing that they were socially engineered)
5. As mentioned earlier, the branching really just controls how much and what information students are working with. The storyline is mostly linear, perhaps with a major 2-way branching scenario towards the end to keep things a bit easier.
6. Approx 6 per group with about 5 simultaneous sessions occuring in the room. Personas would be great, as long as they're equitable and meaningful. If they don't make any tangible difference to the role play/game play, don't bother with them.
NOTE: I like the idea of having action tokens - limited resources that represent time, money and effort. Students make decisions on how they spend their limited action tokens. Once they're spent, they're spent.

Assessment & Artefact Questions
7. Entirely during the session.
8. Assessed both collaboratively and individually.

Tone & Experience Questions
9. Hybrid stress level - progressively dial it up throughout the duration of each session.
10. Plan for simple text briefs with opportunities to replace text artifacts with media artefacts. Most of them could be realistic and lo-fi, e.g. a Teams meeting recording or a voice mail message.
